                    <p>Berserk follows the story of Guts, the "Black Swordsman," a former mercenary wandering a dark medieval world. Born from a hanged corpse, Guts' life is one of constant struggle and violence. He is recruited by the charismatic Griffith into the mercenary group, the "Band of the Hawk." Guts finds a semblance of camaraderie, but Griffith's ambition leads to a cataclysmic betrayal known as the Eclipse, transforming Griffith into a demon lord and sacrificing his comrades. Branded for sacrifice, Guts survives but is forever hunted by demonic spirits. He embarks on a brutal quest for revenge against Griffith and the demonic Apostles.</p>

                    <h2>Plot</h2>
                    <p>The story details the life of Guts, from his grim childhood to his time as a mercenary and his fateful encounter with Griffith. It explores deep themes of free will versus destiny, the nature of humanity, and the search for meaning in a cruel world. After the Eclipse, Guts, accompanied by the elf Puck, hunts Apostles while battling his own inner darkness, symbolized by the "Beast of Darkness." His journey becomes more complex as he slowly gathers new companions, including the young witch Schierke, forcing him to choose between his quest for vengeance and protecting those he has come to care for.</p>

                    <p>Land of the Lustrous (Houseki no kuni) is set in a far distant future where Earth has been struck by meteors six times, destroying the ecosystem. A new life form has emerged: the Lustrous (Gems), immortal beings made of crystalline material. They live under the care of their teacher, Adamant (Kongo-sensei), and are constantly at war with the Lunarians (Moon Dwellers), who descend from the moon to shatter the Gems and use their bodies as decorations. Each Gem has a different hardness, making some more suited for battle than others.</p>

                    <h2>Plot</h2>
                    <p>The story follows Phosphophyllite (Phos), a young, arrogant Gem with a hardness of only 3.5, making them too fragile to fight. Phos is desperate to be useful and is assigned the task of creating an encyclopedia of natural history. This seemingly simple job leads Phos to Cinnabar, a Gem with a poison-based body who is isolated due to their dangerous nature. Phos's desire to find a better job for Cinnabar and to become stronger sets off a chain of events. Over the course of the story, Phos loses parts of their body and has them replaced with other materials, leading to profound physical and psychological transformations in a long, existential journey of self-discovery and loss of innocence.</p>

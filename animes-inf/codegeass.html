                    <p>The story is set in an alternate timeline where the Holy Britannian Empire has conquered Japan, now known as "Area 11," using powerful robotic weapons called Knightmare Frames. Lelouch vi Britannia is an exiled Britannian prince living in Area 11. He harbors a deep hatred for the empire and his father, the Emperor, after his mother was assassinated and his sister, Nunnally, was left blind and crippled. One day, he encounters a mysterious, immortal girl named C.C., who grants him a powerful ability called Geass—the "Power of Kings."</E-p>

                    <h2>Plot</h2>
                    <p>Lelouch's Geass allows him to issue absolute commands to anyone who makes direct eye contact with him. Adopting the masked identity of "Zero," he begins to build a resistance movement, "The Black Knights," to fight for Japan's independence and create a new world for Nunnally. His journey forces him to become a master tactician and manipulator, often battling his own childhood friend, Suzaku Kururugi, who fights for Britannia from within. The story is a complex web of mecha battles, high-stakes strategy, political intrigue, and supernatural powers, all leading to one of the most famous and debated endings in anime history.</p>

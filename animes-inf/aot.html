                    <p>The story is set in a world where humanity lives within three enormous walls that protect them from gigantic, man-eating humanoids known as Titans. The story follows Eren Yeager, his adoptive sister Mikasa Ackerman, and their friend Armin Arlert. Their lives are shattered when the "Colossal Titan" and "Armored Titan" breach their home, Wall Maria, leading to the death of Eren's mother. Vowing revenge, Eren joins the Survey Corps, an elite military branch that combats Titans outside the walls, and swears to wipe every last Titan from the face of the Earth.</p>

                    <h2>Plot</h2>
                    <p>As Eren and his comrades fight the Titans, they begin to uncover dark secrets about their world. They discover that some humans can transform into Titans, and that their own government and history are built on lies. The true enemy is not just the monsters outside the walls, but also the complex political and historical conflicts that span generations. The story evolves from a tale of survival against monsters into a morally complex war drama, questioning who the real "monsters" are and exploring themes of freedom, oppression, and the cycle of hatred.</p>

                    <p>Steins;Gate follows Rintaro Okabe, a self-proclaimed "mad scientist" who runs the "Future Gadget Laboratory" in Akihabara with his friends, Mayuri Shiina and Itaru "Daru" Hashida. While attempting to create a time machine out of a modified microwave oven, Okabe and his friends discover they can send text messages to the past. These messages, dubbed "D-Mails," subtly alter the present. Their experiments soon attract the attention of SERN, a shadowy organization that has also been researching time travel and is willing to kill to protect its monopoly on the technology.</p>

                    <h2>Plot</h2>
                    <p>Okabe's tampering with the past creates multiple "world lines." He gains the ability to retain memories from previous timelines, a power he calls "Reading Steiner." When SERN agents track them down and murder Mayuri, Okabe is forced to "leap" back in time repeatedly to try and save her. However, he discovers that his attempts to save Mayuri often result in the death of another friend, Kurisu Makise. The plot centers on Okabe's desperate struggle to undo the D-Mails he sent, navigate the consequences of his actions, and find the one "Steins Gate" world line where both Mayuri and Kurisu can live.</p>

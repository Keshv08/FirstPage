                    <p>Breaking Bad follows Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who is underpaid, overqualified, and living a mild-mannered life. His world is turned upside down when he is diagnosed with inoperable Stage III lung cancer. To secure his family's financial future before he dies, Walt uses his chemistry expertise to "break bad." He teams up with a former student, Jesse Pinkman, to produce and distribute crystal methamphetamine. He adopts the alias "Heisenberg" as his criminal persona.</p>

                    <h2>Plot</h2>
                    <p>As Walt and Jesse build their drug empire, they must navigate the violent and unpredictable criminal underworld. This includes dealing with unhinged dealers, rival cartels, and the calculating cartel distributor, Gus Fring. Walt's descent into darkness is contrasted with his efforts to maintain his family life with his wife, Skyler, and son, Walter Jr. A major source of tension is his brother-in-law, Hank Schrader, who is a DEA agent actively hunting the mysterious "Heisenberg." The series is a study of transformation, exploring how a seemingly good man's pride, ego, and choices can lead to his moral decay and destruction.</p>

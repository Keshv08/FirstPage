                    <p>The story follows Ken Kaneki, a normal college student who, after a date, is attacked by a "ghoul," a creature that looks human but survives by eating human flesh. The ghoul, Rize Kamishiro, dies in an accident during the attack, but Kaneki is critically injured. Doctors perform an emergency surgery, transplanting Rize's organs into him to save his life. This operation turns him into a one-eyed, half-human, half-ghoul hybrid. Kaneki must now learn to live in a world where he belongs to neither humans nor ghouls.</p>

                    <h2>Plot</h2>
                    <p>Struggling to control his new ghoul instincts and his craving for human flesh, Kaneki is taken in by the ghouls who run the "Anteiku" coffee shop. Anteiku is a group that tries to blend into human society and live peacefully, sourcing their "food" from suicide victims. Kaneki must navigate the complex social structures of the ghoul world, including their different factions and territories, while also hiding his identity from his human friend, Hide. All the while, he is hunted by the CCG (Commission of Counter Ghoul), a federal agency tasked with exterminating ghouls.</p>
